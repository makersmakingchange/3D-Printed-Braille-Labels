# Overview

The OpenSCAD Braille font module allows an individual to customize and create 3D printable labels with Braille. 3D printed Braille is easy to print, does not take long, and requires little filament. Braille labels can be added to existing devices to increase accessibility or printed for the user's specific needs.

The OpenSCAD file can create properly spaced and standardized Braille letters, NEMETH numbers, mathematical operators, and some common contractions. Instructions on how to use the OpenSCAD program to create these labels are explained in the documentation of this project.

# Usage

The 3D printed Braille labels are intended to be used in the same way as standard Braille. The Braille labels can be glued or stuck to various surfaces. The Braille labels can also be incorporated in other 3D printed models as well, for example, on the side of another assistive device such as a switch.

# Build Instructions

The documentation includes an explainer document and video on how to use the OpenSCAD Braille template. If you are fulfilling this request for a requestor please take a look at the maker checklist document before you start the build to help you walk through the process.
